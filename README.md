## FAQ
**Q: Is this academic dishonesty?**  
A: No. We provide guidance and mentoring to help you learn and implement solutions independently.

**Q: How quickly can you complete my project?**  
A: Turnaround depends on complexity and workload. Book early for urgency (3-4 weeks before deadline).

**Q: What technologies do you support?**  
A: Software (Java/C++/Python), Hardware (Arduino/ESP32/STM32), Networking (OSPF/BGP), and more.
